Acceptance Criteria
1. File present, if file doesn't exists - raise an error
2. Application works with json read and save
3. Promt user with options:
   a. Add entry
   b. Find entry:
        Search by first name
        Search by last name
        Search by full name
        Search by telephone number
        Search by city or state
   c. Delete entry by phonenumber
   d. Update entry by phonenumber
   e. Exit app
4. Save phone book into json file after exit
5. Read existing phonebook from json file
The first argument to the application should be the name of the phonebook.
Algorithm:
1. open file
2. raise an error if file doesn't exist
3. read json
4. if during reading error appears ignore and create empty list
5. try except finally on global level to save file anyway
6. Print menu
7. if user selected add new record:
   1. Ask user put data
   2. Append data to list
8. if user selected search/delete record:
   1. ...
