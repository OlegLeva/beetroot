Written in Lisp, the system simulated a robot arm and could reason about how to move blocks around in its simulated environment. It could also explain its reasoning to you if you asked it why it took a specific action. I have an old Lisp textbook from 1968-ish that has the code as an example. Funnily, although Design Patterns for code were not \"invented\" or discussed until the late '90's or early 2000s, the code uses a clear example of what would come to be termed of as the [Memento Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern), and also uses object oriented design, which software engineers wouldn't even speak of in those terms until the late 80's or early 90's. The Lisp guys were doing it *three decades* earlier.\n\n\nAnywhoo, the point of this long-winded and rather nerdy intro is that now that we have the processing power and hardware to actually do this in the real world, it'd be a *really fun* project to put together a demo that you could talk to in recognizable English and have the system reason and drive an actual robot arm like this to perform work for a user. That's where the really powerful applications of these technologies where start to come into play.",

Arecibo's instruments were not as dated as the structure itself, and while there are definitely more modern radio telescopes out there, there are also advantages to a single dish system too.  Arecibo could use active sensing systems like radar, as well as passive sensing.  \n\n\nIt was still an active and scientifically useful instrument, and the world of radio astronomy feels its loss deeply.    \n\n\nRIP you big beautiful dish."
