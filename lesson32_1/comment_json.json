I plan on updating the GUI textures eventually but the style will stay the same. The name also will not change. It's a nice word, it explains the process of the pack/how I started making it. And, more importantly, it's the only pack with this name. It's been called Serendipity for a long time and changing it would also be confusing/weaken the association between the name and the pack/style. What exactly seems off about it to you?\n\nMobs will mostly stay the same as well. Also, it's important to note (in case you have no experience with these things) that everything you've listed is ambiguous and would take days to change everything. If you have more specific criticism/advice I'd be more open to hearing it\n\nThanks all the same, glad you like the pack. Appreciate the feedback",
